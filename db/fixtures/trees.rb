	s.description = "Tītoki is a canopy tree growing to 9 m in height. It has a twisting trunk with smooth dark bark. It produces small purple flowers in spring and the seeds take up to a year to mature. The colourful seed is initially contained in a hairy woody capsule which splits revealing bright red and black unpalatable fruit (the black portion being the seed). The fruit is a favourite food of the kererū."

	s.description = "Tōtara is found from lowlands to subalpine forests at a maximum elevation of 600m. Capable of growing up to 40m, it is noted for its longevity and the great girth of its trunk. The bark peels off in papery flakes, with a purplish to golden brown hue. The sharp, dull green needle-like leaves are stiff and leathery, 2 cm long.  Māori boat builders chose it due to its relatively light weight (about 25% lighter than kauri), long straight lengths and natural oils in the wood which help prevent rotting."

Kahikatea is the largest tree native to Aotearoa with records from early settlers showing specimen of over 80m. Soot obtained from burning the heartwood supplied a pigment for tā moko. Since the wood does not impart an odour, and is clean and lightweight, Kahikatea was used to make boxes for the exporting of butter from the 1880s on."

The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 3–4cm long bearing 1-6 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, 10–15mm long, violet-purple with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. Matai has round blue-black fruit which is enjoyed by käkä and kererū. Although quite slimy the fruit are sweet and were eaten by early Mäori. When mataï was being felled for timber, bushmen drilled the base of standing trees to collect a sap known as mataï beer."

	s.description = "Rimu leaves are spirally arranged, thin and pointy, up to 7mm long on juvenile plants, and 1mm wide; and 2-3 mm long on mature trees. It is dioecious, with male and female cones on separate trees; the seeds take 15 months to mature after pollination. The mature cones comprise a swollen red fleshy scale 6-10mm long bearing one seed. It is an important food source for the kākāpō, whose breeding cycle has been linked to the cone production cycle of the tree."
