It produces small purple flowers in spring and the seeds take up to a year to mature. The colourful seed is initially contained in a hairy woody capsule which splits revealing bright red and black unpalatable fruit (the black portion being the seed). The fruit is a favourite food of the kererū."

The bark peels off in papery flakes, with a purplish to golden brown hue. The sharp, dull green needle-like leaves are stiff and leathery, 2 cm long.  Māori boat builders chose it due to its relatively light weight (about 25% lighter than kauri), long straight lengths and natural oils in the wood which help prevent rotting."

Soot obtained from burning the heartwood supplied a pigment for tā moko. Since the wood does not impart an odour, and is clean and lightweight, Kahikatea was used to make boxes for the exporting of butter from the 1880s on. On young plants the leaves are 3-8mm long and twisted at the base to lie spread to the sides of the shoot in a flat plane; on mature trees, they are scale-like, 1-3 mm long, and placed all round the shoot."

The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 3–4cm long bearing 1-6 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, 10–15mm long, violet-purple with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. Matai has round blue-black fruit which is enjoyed by käkä and kererū. Although quite slimy the fruit are sweet and were eaten by early Mäori. When mataï was being felled for timber, bushmen drilled the base of standing trees to collect a sap known as mataï beer."

It is dioecious, with male and female cones on separate trees; the seeds take 15 months to mature after pollination. The mature cones comprise a swollen red fleshy scale 6-10mm long bearing one seed. It is an important food source for the kākāpō, whose breeding cycle has been linked to the cone production cycle of the tree."

The fruit is a small cupule containing three seeds. Pollen from the tree was found near the Antarctic Peninsula showing that it formerly grew i Antarctica since the Eocene period."

This, in turn, is the result of a scale insect which sucks sap from the tree, and excretes honeydew, a sweet liquid, in small droplets (less than 1 mm diameter) on the end of stalks. This feeds the sooty mold, and also forms a valuable high-energy food source for various birds and insects including the kākā. The infestation is common and does not appear to harm the tree."

The tiny red male flowers are bell-shaped and produced in large numbers while the female flowers, which are green tipped with brown, are in groups of three on short stalks growing in the axils of the leaves.
